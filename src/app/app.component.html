            Bring your favorite chefs, bloggers, and YouTubers into your home with PreHeat. Each week,
            choose a meal plan curated by one of PreHeat&#39;s diverse content creators. In addition to their
            delicious recipes, your weekly subscription directly supports your PreHeat Creator and helps
            them do what they love. Then, take the stress out of shopping with an automatically generated
            (and editable!) grocery list. You can even place your grocery order with Instacart, Shiply,
            Amazon Pantry or other delivery services with the press of a button!

                Each week, log onto PreHeat and browse the meal plans that the PreHeat Creators have curated
                for that week. Once you decide which tasty plan strikes your fancy, you&#39;ll gain access to the full
                recipes with step by step directions! Your week-long subscription also grants you access to
                exclusive content that your Creator includes. After choosing your meal play, all the ingredients
                you need are automatically generated into a grocery list that you can edit right there in the app.
                Get going to the store or have your groceries delivered to your door. Then, just cook and enjoy!
